The primary color is a very dark greenish-black used for text and accents, providing a subtle uniqueness over pure black. Pastel color bands in muted lavender and pale blue add gentle color highlights without overpowering the design. Typography is a key element, combining a high-contrast serif font for headings with delicate italic serif accents, conveying formality and refinement. The layout is spacious and balanced, using symmetrical grids and generous negative space to create a calm and structured feel. Thin dividing lines and understated buttons reinforce the elegant minimalism. Images are framed cleanly and used sparingly to maintain focus on content and emotion. Overall, the design communicates a sophisticated, warm, and timeless brand identity suitable for formal and intimate occasions.",

      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'background' color as the primary canvas for all pages to maintain a soft and warm base. The 'primary' color is ideal for main text, headings, and key UI elements, ensuring strong readability and a sophisticated tone. The 'primaryForeground' color is used for text or icons placed on 'primary' backgrounds to maintain contrast. The 'secondary' color serves as a subtle accent for section backgrounds or highlights, paired with 'secondaryForeground' for text to ensure clarity. Custom colors like 'pastelBlue' and 'creamHighlight' are best used as background bands or highlight blocks to add gentle color variation and visual interest without overwhelming the minimal aesthetic. 'SoftGrayText' is suitable for secondary or body text where a softer tone than 'primary' is desired. Colors should be combined thoughtfully to preserve accessibility and the calm, elegant atmosphere, avoiding overly saturated or bright colors.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primary' color on 'background' provides excellent contrast exceeding WCAG AA standards for text readability. The 'secondary' color on 'secondaryForeground' also meets WCAG AA contrast ratios for headings and important text. Custom colors like 'pastelBlue' and 'creamHighlight' used as backgrounds maintain sufficient contrast with 'primary' and 'softGrayText' for body text and UI elements. Button text in 'primaryForeground' on 'primary' backgrounds ensures clear visibility. Overall, the palette supports accessible typography and UI components with careful color role usage."
